# Snake
 
### Classic game "Snake" created using Unity engine. 
 
The player scores points by collecting apples, that are randomly generated on the screen (one by one). The current and best scores are displayed on the screen in real time. 
Each collected apple makes the snake longer. Collision with walls or snake's body ends the game. After a defeat, the player can play again or quit the game. The best score is saved in the game files, so the player has the opportunity to beat that score the next time he plays.

The player can control the snake using the arrows or the WASD keys.
